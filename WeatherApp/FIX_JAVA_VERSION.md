# Fixed: Java Version Issue

## Problem
Error: "Unsupported class file major version 65"

This occurs when Gradle encounters class files compiled with Java 21 (version 65) but is trying to compile with Java 17 (version 61).

## Solution Applied

Updated Gradle configuration to enforce Java 17 compatibility:

### 1. android/build.gradle
Added at the end of the file:
```gradle
// Set Java version to 17
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}
```

### 2. android/app/build.gradle
Added in the `android {}` block:
```gradle
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}
```

## What These Changes Do

1. **Forces Java 17 compatibility**: All Java code will be compiled with Java 17
2. **Works with your current setup**: Your Java 17 installation is now properly configured
3. **Eliminates version conflicts**: Prevents the "class file major version 65" error

## Next Steps

1. **In Android Studio:**
   - File → Invalidate Caches / Restart
   - Select "Invalidate and Restart"
   - Build → Rebuild Project

2. **Try building again:**
   - The build should now succeed without the Java version error

## Verification

To verify Java version in use:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew --version
```

You should see:
```
JVM: 17.0.17
```

## Alternative Solution (If Still Having Issues)

If the error persists, you can also set the JAVA_HOME environment variable:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Then restart Android Studio.
