# How to Run the Weather App

## Starting the App

The app needs the **Metro bundler** (React Native's JavaScript bundler) to be running to load the JavaScript code.

### Option 1: Using Terminal (Current Setup)

The Metro bundler is now running in the background. To verify:

1. Look for the Metro bundler terminal window
2. You should see "Metro waiting on..." message
3. The app on your emulator will now work

### Option 2: Using Android Studio

1. **In Android Studio:**
   - Open the Terminal at the bottom of Android Studio (View → Tool Windows → Terminal)
   - Navigate to the WeatherApp folder: `cd WeatherApp`
   - Run: `npm start`

2. **Then:**
   - Click the **Run** button (▶️) in Android Studio
   - Or run from terminal: `npm run android`

### Option 3: Restart Metro

If Metro stopped working:

```bash
cd WeatherApp
npm start
```

Then press `a` in the Metro terminal to launch on Android

## What You're Seeing

The app currently shows a basic welcome screen because we created a simplified version. The full weather app components are in `src/` but need to be integrated into the main App.tsx.

## Current App Features

✅ Basic React Native setup
✅ Runs on Android
✅ Metro bundler configured
✅ Ready for component integration

## Next Steps to Add Weather Features

1. Integrate the Dashboard component
2. Add navigation
3. Connect to weather API
4. Display real data
